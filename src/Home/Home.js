					Rick: “Help? I travel the galaxy and you want me to waste my genius on
					people?”
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					Morty: “They need us, we can be heroes!”
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					Rick: “Don’t you open your eyes, heroes aren’t real and they die. It’s
					2020 and you still want to help people? I say we get out of earth and
					go anywhere else, like anywhere would be better than this trash
					dumpster of a planet”
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					Morty: “Fine we can blow up Pluto, then will you help?”
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					Rick: “No more is it a planet or not debate at all the bars in the
					galaxy? Just Pluto, oh yeah that is not a thing anymore ”<br></br>
					Rick:”Fine, I’ll help. For the record, we’re wasting our time because
					they couldn’t click the search bar at the top and are still reading
					here for help. I got to tell you Morty, people are useless and we
					should just grab a few beers, maybe a Llama or 2 and leave this place”
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					WHY ARE U STILL READING, CLICK THE DAMN SEARCH BAR
					<br></br>
					Sincerely, Rick (Not sincere at all, I can’t wait for the sun to blow
					and never have to deal with this hell hole ever again)
